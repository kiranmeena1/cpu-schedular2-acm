# CPU Schedular

This project is a simple process scheduling simulator developed using Qt and cpp. It implements four scheduling algorithms: First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin.

## Requirements

- Qt 5 or later
- Qt Creator (optional, but recommended for development)
- cpp

## Installation

1. Download and install Qt from the official website: [https://www.qt.io/download](https://www.qt.io/download).
2. Open Qt Creator.
3. Click on "File" > "Open File or Project" and select the `.pro` file from the downloaded project directory.
4. Build the project by clicking on the green "Run" button in the bottom left corner.

## Usage

1. Enter the number of processes and process details (PID, arrival time, burst time, priority) in the input fields.
2. Select the scheduling algorithm from the dropdown menu.
3. If using Round Robin, enter the quantum value.
4. Click the "Run Scheduling" button to see the scheduling results in the text area.
